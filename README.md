# ❓ Ask Me Anything

Welcome! If you have a question for me — whether it's about code, careers, tools, or anything else — you're in the right place.

## 📌 How to Ask a Question
1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new file in the `questions/` folder (or the root) with your name or GitHub username.
3. Ask your question inside the file (you can use Markdown).
4. Open a Pull Request. I'll respond directly in the PR comments or in your file.

Happy learning! 🚀
