Hi Ketki,
  This is Dhiviya from PAT-C-WE-E-B7 (Python Automation Testing). Hope you are doing well.

Below are the URLs for my Mini Projects and Capstone Project:

  Mini Project 1: https://github.com/Dhiviya-S/MiniProject1_GUVI
  Mini Project 2: https://github.com/Dhiviya-S/MiniProject2_OrangeHR
  Capstone Project: https://github.com/Dhiviya-S/Capstone_SauceDemo_Automation

I received the following scores:
7/10 for both Mini Projects
8/10 for the Capstone Project

In all project reports, the feedback given was: “Repo can be maintained better.”

I have a few questions regarding this:
  1.What mistakes did I make in the repository?
  2.Is it an issue that I made changes after adding files to the GitHub repo?
  3.How can I maintain the repository better?
  4.Are there any other improvements I should consider?


Looking forward to your feedback.
Thank you,
Dhiviya
